**Tips for Your Video:**

*   **Screen Recording:** Use a good screen recording tool (e.g., OBS Studio, QuickTime, Loom).
*   **Clear Audio:** If doing a voiceover, ensure your audio is clear.
*   **Pacing:** Keep the pace energetic but clear. Don't rush through features too quickly.
*   **Visual Focus:** Use your mouse cursor to guide the viewer's attention to what you're talking about.
*   **Practice:** Do a dry run or two to ensure your timing is right.
*   **Music (Optional):** Add some subtle, upbeat background music if it fits your style.

Good luck with your video! It's a great way to showcase your hard work.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Suggestions)
